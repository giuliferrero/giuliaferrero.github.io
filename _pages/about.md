Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Turin and a Phd fellow at Collegio
Carlo Alberto, working under the supervision of [Elena Esposito](https://www.elenaesposito.com/) and [Giovanni Mastrobuoni](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannimastrobuoni/).

I am an applied micro-economist specializing in economic history, media, and development
economics — with a particular focus on gender-related issues. 

My research examines howsocietal and cultural norms around women evolve, particularly in response to historical and
contemporary events, including conflicts as potential catalysts for change. I analyze narratives
using archival media sources such as newspapers, women’s magazines, and movies.

I hold a Master’s degree in Economics from the University of Bologna.
